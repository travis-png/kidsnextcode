•	What is a subject in access control?
•	What is an object?
•	What are rules?
•	Give a real-life example (like school lockers, library books, or computer logins).
•	Why do these accounts need stronger protection?
•	Give one example of a privileged account in real life and what they may have access to that other people wouldn’t (hint: school principal, system admin, etc.).
